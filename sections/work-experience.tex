    {NLP Research Engineer Intern}
    {Jan. 2025 - Present}{Atlanta, GA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Building sub-billion-parameter domain-specific LMs for chatbot assistants running on edge/web, focused on the shopping domain

    % \item Innovating new dialog data synthesis pipeline with RAG \& sub-billion-paremeter LM training pipeline for domain-specific chatbots running on edge/web
    \item Proposed and engineered an innovative and high-quality data synthesis pipeline,
    leveraging Diverse query sampling, Syntactic \& semantic deduplication,
    Generative query transformations,
    RAG, Prompt-tuning and Structured outputs for reasoning elicitation
    % Prompt-tuning for structured reasoning
    %  and improved instruction following

    % \item Presenting recent LLM advancements, data generation plan and ideas weekly within team of 6; Iteratively developing for a shopping mall case-study

    \item Pioneered vLLM inference integration with distributed torchrun training,
    % overcoming lack of existing solutions and high technical risk
    overcoming significant technical challenges
    through extensive self-driven codebase exploration,
    % overcoming significant technical barriers with lack of existing solutions,
    % achieving 2X training speedup
    achieving 2X faster training

    % \item Prompt-tuning GPT4o-mini to elicit reasoning for high-quality instruction-following and diverse user query generation

    % Optimizing system prompts with general information & RAG  by manual inspection

    % \item Developed LM that matched performance of previous chatbot using 10X less data and compute in initial trial
    \item Designed robust template-based hallucination benchmark targeting domain-specific data attributes,
    reducing LM hallucination rate by 4X

    \item Conducted extensive experiments (200+ training runs), evaluating advanced training techniques including
    Dynamic user query augmentations via randomized programmatic editing,
    Custom token embeddings, LoRA, Reasoning chain distillation

    \item Delivered a model significantly
    % outperform versions prior to joining,
    outperforming previous versions,
    on query understanding and response quality,
    % reaching a stage
    % involving product manager
    % for potential deployment,
    approaching deployment readiness
    with 40\% less data, 40\% fewer parameters and 10X less training compute

    % \item Augmenting user queries via generative and programmatic editing for diverse query understanding
